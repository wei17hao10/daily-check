# Daily Check Tool

## Backgroud
This is a tool aiming to simplify the steps of daily check operations.

## Design
I thought it would be a very simple tool, but actually it gets more and more complicated when new ideas come to me.
Below is the simple description of some files in the project.
- Checks : The folder where manual and sql checking rule are placed.
- History : The folder where the daily check history results are placed.
- UI : The folder where all the UI definition file are placed.
- config : The folder where the database and user configuration file are placed.
- images: The folder where all the icons and pictures are placed.
- lib : just put one py file there, seems no necessary.
- lib/share.py : The file that defines all the data structure and functions.
- **main.py** : The file that is used to start the application.
- **uiClass.py** : The file that defines the actual function of all the UIs.

### Other info would be added if needed.
